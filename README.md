# X-Cuber (Rubik’s Cube Solver) – using Korf’s IDA* Algorithm

**GitHub:** [Link](https://github.com/iamprofessor1/X-Cuber)

## Description

In this project, I engineered a virtual Rubik’s Cube (3x3) solver using Korf’s IDA* algorithm. The entire implementation was meticulously designed in C++. I organized the project into three distinct models/classes, ensuring a well-structured and efficient solution.

## Key Achievements

The core achievement of this project was attaining exceptional solving times for challenging scenarios:

- Successfully solved a Rubik’s Cube that was jumbled 8 times using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms in less than 3 seconds.
- Implemented Korf’s IDA* Algorithm to achieve an impressive solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik’s Cube that was jumbled 13 times.
